### What I learned

Getting this layout responsive was not easy and straight forward as I initially thought specifically the hero section. I had to use the `:before` pseudo element on the header to get the blue shade background so that the calculator and the heading should adjust without breaking when the screen is resized. I'm glad with how it turned out making it responsive and implementing the functionality to get the get the required result.
